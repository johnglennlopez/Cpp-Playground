These are notes for my self so I can practice concepts I'm not understanding when I have time.

Lacking an understanding of the following:
	[x] this-> operator
	[ ] how can I utilize pointers in c++?

Practice the following:
	[x] practice (*a).b aka a->b pointer operators on class member accessors
	[ ] practice linked lists (could be important to know how to do this)
	[ ] practice vectors and arrays
	[ ] practice using arrays in classes (array = new int[])
	[ ] practice copy constructors
	[ ] practice copy assignment operator (overloading =)
