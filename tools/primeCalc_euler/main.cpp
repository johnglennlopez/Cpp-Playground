/*
	WITHOUT USING MATH.H (using Eulers Theorym)
	This is a simple way of calculating if a number is prime or not
	using 6n-1 and 6n+1. It is only ~90% acurate (1-10000) and increasing
	as the number gets larger. Examples of inacuracies are 25, 917 etc.. these
	will register as a prime number (they are not).

	Formula is: 6n-1 = 'your number' || 6n+1 = 'your number'
	To use: #include calcPrime.cpp and use calcPrime(int);

	If a number is a prime, it will return a 1
	If a number is NOT prime, it will return a 0

	//example for using calcPrime.cpp
